## **Object Oriented Programming and Design: Assignment 1**

### **_Question 1:_**

- > **We have to calculate Longterm Capital Gain Tax and Selling Price**
- > _We have formula of SellingPrice is:_  ![alt text](image-4.png)
- > _Profit:  ![alt text](image-2.png)_
- > _LTCG Tax: (SellingPrice - CostPrice) x taxPercentage_ - Here we takes 20% taxPercentage on profit. ![alt text](image-3.png)

> > **Here we takes input from user in which year they wants to sell their properties.**

- - _Initially Brought Year: 2010_
- - _Brought Price: 50 Lakhs_
- - _Find Selling Price_
- - _Find LTCG Tax_

### **_Question 2:_**

- > **We have to calculate Longterm Capital Gain Tax and Selling Price**
- > _Here we have to change Selling Price Formulla:_
- > - _Before 2024:_ ![alt text](image-4.png)
- > - _On and After 2024:_ ![alt text](image-1.png)
- > _Profit:_
- > - _Before 2024:_ ![alt text](image-2.png)
- > - _On and After 2024:
- > _LTCG Tax:_
- > - _Before 2024 (Here we takes 20% taxPercentage on profit):_  ![alt text](image-3.png)
- > - _On and After 2024 (But in and after 2024 we takes 12.5% taxPercentage on profit according new policy):_ ![alt text](image-5.png)

> > **Here we takes input from user in which year they wants to sell their properties.**

- - _Initially Brought Year: 2010_
- - _Brought Price: 50 Lakhs_
- - _Find Selling Price_
- - _Find LTCG Tax_


> #### Here we have to create make file it shown like that: ![alt text](image.png)
> > - **In Makefile we write some terminal commands.**
> > - ***-c :** command used to compiler cpp file without creating object file (.o).*
> > - ***-g :** command used to Debuggs compiled file and **' -o '** used to assing name of the output files like debug1, debug2, so on. [Shown in image].*
> > - ***-O3 :** This is called obtimised flag command which helps to optimize our code.*
